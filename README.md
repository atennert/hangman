# Hangman

This is a simple website hangman implementation in TypeScript.

## Features
* Offline capable web app
* Start a new run with the start/reset button
* Use the provided on-screen keyboard or a real keyboard
* Animated hanging stick figure
* List of a few german nouns (It's temporary. I'm trying to find a service for that. If I can't find one, I'll make the list bigger eventually.)
* Landscape and portrait mode
